-------------
Version 1.0.4
-------------

implemented:
- the statement API to support the SQLStatement class (DBI_CAP_HAS_STATEMENT)
- support for binding and retrieving "number" values
- support for driver options
- support for time zones in date/time values (DBI_CAP_TIME_ZONE_SUPPORT)
- support for arbitrary-precision numbers (DBI_CAP_HAS_NUMBER_SUPPORT)
- support for server-side time zones (DBI_CAP_SERVER_TIME_ZONE)
- fixed auto-reconnect functionality (https://github.com/qorelanguage/qore/issues/131)
- removed trailing colon from error msgs (https://github.com/qorelanguage/qore/issues/312)
- fixed returning decimal values; they were returned with too-high precision numbers which caused comparisons with the original number to fail
- implemented support for the following DBI options:
  - "optimal-numbers": return numeric types as an integer if possible, if not as an arbitrary-precision number
  - "string-numbers": return numeric types as strings (for backwards-compatibility)
  - "numeric-numbers": return numeric types as arbitrary-precision number values
  - "timezone": accepts a string argument that can be either a region name (ex: "Europe/Prague") or a UTC offset (ex: "+01:00") to set the server's time zone rules; this is useful if connecting to a database server in a different time zone.  If this option is not set then the server's time zone is assumed to be the same as the client's time zone
- the default for the number options is now "optimal-numbers", meaning that NUMERIC or DECIMAL values are retrieved as integers if possible, otherwise an arbitrary-precision number type is returned
- fixed varchar handling with freetds; freetds processes bind arguments differently than Sybase's ctlib and strings were sent with an extra space on the end that was stripped from the string when the value was returned from the DB (bug 563)


-------------
Version 1.0.3
-------------

implemented support for specifying the hostname and port in the datasource in
order to override the interfaces file; requires qore 0.7.5+

fixed auto-reconnect to mark the Datasource as closed when auto-reconnect
fails; otherwise a crash could result when the Datasource is reused

implemented execRaw() method

use new date/time APIs when compiled against qore 0.8.0+


-------------
Version 1.0.2
-------------

added auto-reconnect feature to driver; will automatically reconnect to the
server if the connection is dropped while not in a transaction.
Auto-reconnect has been tested with both sybase and freetds drivers.

updated configure to check the directory specified with --prefix first when
looking for dependent libraries


-------------
Version 1.0.1
-------------

fixed module naming and module directory handling to correspond to changes in
qore 0.7.1

made qore 0.7.1 the minimum version for compiling the module


-----------
Version 1.0
-----------

Initial release; see README for more information
