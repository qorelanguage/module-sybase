FreeTDS 0.64 (stable) connected to a local Sybase 15.0 server
has different behavior to native CT library:

* MONEY and MONEY4 conversions into double
  incorrectly round the float number.
  See conversions_tests.cc.

* cs_locale(CS_SYB_CHARSET) returns empty string
  as the default encoding (CT library returns "utf8").
  See encoding_helpers_tests.cc. 
  Setting it and reading it again doesn't help.

* For ct_command(CS_RPC_CMD) (i.e. calling procedure)
  if one passes procedure parameters by position 
  (i.e. not by name as in Sybase examples)
  then the subsequent ct_send() fails.
  This makes calling procedures impossible
  (ct_dynamic() works here but it doesn't 
   support TEXT and IMAGE datatypes).
